This project was created for usage as a portfolio. The following steps were used.

1. Create a new React project using npx create-react-app. Instructions found here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

2. Default project build was gutted by removing files that were unimportant at the time.

3. Added a hero background image (With help from guide found here: https://love2dev.com/blog/responsive-hero-background-opacity/)

4. Design, create and modify components for broad usage within the project. Bootstrap components were also used.
